# CRUD Application with ADO.NET and SQLite
This repository contains a basic CRUD application built using ADO.NET and SQLite, following best programming practices and design patterns. The application allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a Driver model, which includes fields for FirstName, LastName, Email, and PhoneNumber. The application is designed to compile and execute flawlessly and serves as a robust foundation for more complex applications.

# Features:
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are implemented using ADO.NET, ensuring data integrity and security.
- SQLite Database: The application uses SQLite, a lightweight and efficient RDBMS, to store and manage data.
- Random Data Generation: Functionality is included to insert a list of 10 random driver names into the database, providing realistic data for testing and demonstration.
- Alphabetical Sorting: The application supports alphabetical sorting of the driver names, both for displaying the current users and returning individual names in alphabetical order.
- REST API: The CRUD operations are exposed through a REST API, allowing seamless integration with other systems and applications.
- Web Interface and Swagger: If you prefer a web interface, the application includes Swagger documentation for easy testing and exploration of API endpoints.

# Technologies Used:
- C#: The application is written in C# for robust, object-oriented programming.
- ADO.NET: ADO.NET is utilized for database interactions, ensuring efficient and secure data operations without relying on an ORM framework.
- SQLite: SQLite serves as the backend database, offering a reliable and lightweight solution for data storage.
- ASP.NET Core: The application is built on ASP.NET Core, providing a flexible and scalable framework for developing web applications and APIs.
